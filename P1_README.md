# Excel Project: Bike Buyers Data Analysis

This project showcases my Excel data analysis skills, including cleaning, organizing, and visualizing a real-world dataset. The workbook follows a structured process from raw data to final insights, with visual outputs and dashboards.


## Excel Workbook Structure

Inside the Excel file, you'll find the following sheets:

- **`bike_buyers`** â€“ The original raw dataset.
- **`Working Sheet`** â€“ Cleaned version of the raw data. This sheet was used for data transformation and preparation.
- **`Pivot Table`** â€“ Contains pivot tables used for summarizing and analyzing key metrics.
- **`Dashboard`** â€“ A visual summary using charts and slicers to display key insights interactively.
- **`Comments`** â€“ A step-by-step record of the tasks completed during the project.

## Key Steps Completed

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Removed duplicate records
- Standardized column headings
